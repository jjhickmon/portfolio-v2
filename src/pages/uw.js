                Simply put, I have loved TA-ing for the Startup 190 courses
                because I have enjoyed connecting with students through
                check-ins, and I would like to bring my expertise to the team
                this year. I have been a TA for this series since the Spring
                quarter of my first year, and since then I have gained a
                significant amount of experience, not just in teaching
                introductory concepts, but also techniques to fit many unique
                learning styles and a deeper understanding of the new 12X course
                structure.
                <br />
                <br />
                Along with this, performing check-ins has taught me methods of
                connecting with students, even if they feel somewhat unmotivated
                to learn. I frequently bring my own experiences from research,
                software engineering, and advanced coursework to show students
                how introductory programming topics are used in the real world.
                I aim to use this knowledge to improve the class as a whole, and
                to better instruct future students.

                A few of my major contributions inclcude:

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrote unit testing code for both CSE 190X and check-ins
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consistently positive student feedback after check-ins
                    </li>
                </ul>
