                is a shipping platform that connects sellers and marketplaces to
                couriers. For the duration of my internship, I led the design
                and development of a new feature to enable bulk shipping for

                sellers. This feature allowed sellers to ship multiple orders at
                once, significantly increasing the efficiency of their shipping
                process by reducing the time spent on individual shipping
                orders.

                Through this internship, I built technologies within a large,
                distributed computing environment that improved the experience
                of millions of Amazon sellers worldwide. Along with this, I
                designed and developed features for a full-stack mobile
                application with a heavy focus on RESTful APIs, high-quality
                code architecture, and test automation. These contributions
                significantly improved the Amazon seller experience by allowing{" "}
