                    Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in image classification, 
                    an essential task for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. 
                    Despite this importance, many issues can arise from traditional multimodal image classification methods; 
                    however, two are particularly challenging. First, fine-grained image classification is 
                    unachievable if the model is too small and underfits the data. Second, if the model wasnâ€™t 
                    trained on enough high-quality data or a modality lacks enough representation of a class, the model 
                    may contain inherent bias.

            <p>
                We propose Multimodal Synthetic Embeddings as a framework to reduce the impact of these issues on pre-trained models. 
                By leveraging open-vocabulary models, We aim to generate vision-language descriptions that emphasize 
                the differences between similar classes, improving fine-grained classification accuracy without any 
                additional training or fine-tuning.
